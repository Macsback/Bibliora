The Razor's Edge,"Larry Darrell is a young American in search of the absolute.

Lilith – The First Eve,"In a fascinating excursion through the history of her myth, Siegmund Hurwitz presents and interprets the ancient dark-winged goddess Lilith, also known as ’the first Eve.’ The author’s extraordinarily meticulous study of the original sources brings to light a striking figure long lost from our awareness, yet highly relevant to a psychological understanding of today’s evolving masculine and feminine identities. Case material from his analytical practice imbeds Lilith in the everyday problems of contemporary life. That an unbridled life-urge which refuses to be assimilated lies behind depression… seems to me to be a new and important discovery. By combining the experience of a contemporary man with this historical material, Siegmund Hurwitz sheds new light on both. -- From the Foreword by Marie-Louise von Franz",9783856309008,2020,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mORzCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15437W

Of Human Bondage,"Of Human Bondage is a novel by W. Somerset Maugham. It is generally agreed to be his masterpiece and to be strongly autobiographical in nature. The Modern Library ranked Of Human Bondage No. 66 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The book begins with the death of Helen Carey, the mother of nine-year-old Philip Carey. Philip's father Henry had died a few months before, and the orphan Philip, born with a club foot, is sent to live with his Aunt Louisa and Uncle William Carey. Early chapters relate Philip's experience at the vicarage. Louisa tries to be a mother to Philip, but his uncle takes a cold disposition towards him. Philip's uncle has a vast collection of books, and Philip enjoys reading to find ways to escape his mundane existence. Less than a year later, Philip is sent to a boarding school. His uncle and aunt wish for him to eventually attend Oxford. Philip's disability makes it difficult for him to fit in. Philip is informed that he could have earned a scholarship for Oxford, which both his uncle and school headmaster see as a wise course, but Philip insists on going to Germany. In Germany, Philip lives at a boarding house with other foreigners. Philip enjoys his stay in Germany. Philip's guardians decide to take matters into their own hands and they convince him to move to take up an apprenticeship...

Anna Karenina,"Love... it means too much to me, far more than you can understand. At its simplest, Anna Karenina is a love story. It is a portrait of a beautiful and intelligent woman whose passionate love for a handsome officer sweeps aside all other ties - to her marriage and to the network of relationships and moral values that bind the society around her. The love affair of Anna and Vronsky is played out alongside the developing romance of Kitty and Levin, and in the character of Levin, closely based on Tolstoy himself, the search for happiness takes on a deeper philosophical significance. One of the greatest novels ever written, Anna Karenina combines penetrating psychological insight with an encyclopedic depiction of Russian life in the 1870s. The novel takes us from high society St Petersburg to the threshing fields on Levin's estate, with unforgettable scenes at a Moscow ballroom, the skating rink, a race course, a railway station. It creates an intricate labyrinth of connections that is profoundly satisfying, and deeply moving. Rosamund Bartlett's translation conveys Tolstoy's precision of meaning and emotional accuracy in an English version that is highly readable and stylistically faithful. Like her acclaimed biography of Tolstoy, it is vivid, nuanced, and compelling.",9780191662249,2014-08-28,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fkf1AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL267096W

Set against the backdrop of a world consuming itself in war, the novel creates an instructive vision of humanity's dance with life and death."" ""This text is the famous ""first"" Women in Love, the unexpurgated version preferred by Lawrence himself, which was rejected by every publisher because of the banning of The Rainbow in 1915. More positive in tone than the revised version published in his lifetime, with different central relationships and a radically different ending, it is now viewed by many as Lawrence's masterpiece.""--BOOK JACKET.",9780521280419,1987-05-21,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5qolPyJ8pHgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL81294W
The Secret of Chimneys,"The Secret of Chimneys Never do favors—that’s the lesson it would’ve behooved Anthony Cade to learn before getting himself wrapped up in a case of conspiracy and murder. Politician George Lomax has persuaded Lord Caterham to host a weekend party at Chimneys, his country estate. Lomax hopes to cement plans to reinstate the monarchy in Herzegovina. But when the prince of Herzegovina turns up dead, Cade has a lot of explaining to do. After all, his footprints were found on the grounds . . . though not inside the house. The Secret of Chimneys As one criminal conspiracy leads to another, both Scotland Yard and the French Sûreté are on the scene to set things right. Soon, thanks to the detective work of Superintendent Battle, everyone’s secrets—and the secret of Chimneys itself—will be on display. A young drifter finds more than he bargained for when he agrees to deliver a parcel to an English country house… The Secret of Chimneys Little did Anthony Cade suspect that a simple errand on behalf of a friend would make him the centrepiece of a murderous international conspiracy. Someone would stop at nothing to prevent the monarchy being restored in faraway Herzoslovakia. The Secret of Chimneys The combined forces of Scotland Yard and the French Surete can do no better than go in circles – until the final murder at Chimneys, the great country estate that yields up an amazing secret… The Secret of Chimneys At the request of George Lomax, Lord Caterham reluctantly agrees to host a weekend party at his home, Chimneys. A murder occurs in the house, beginning a week of fast-paced events with police among the guests. The novel was well received at first publication, described as more than a murder mystery, as it is a treasure hunt. Later reviews found it a first-class romp and one of the author's best early thrillers. The most recent review says the novel requires a hefty suspension of disbelief. The later reviewers note that descriptions of characters use the terminology of the times in which it was written, and might be considered racist decades later. The Secret of Chimneys The novel was written in 1925. The characters in the story refer to events that occurred about 7 years earlier, that is, at the end of the Great War when the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires were broken up. The war is never mentioned directly. Instead, in Chapter 19, Superintendent Battle says: ""Just over seven years ago, there was a lot what they called reconstruction going on especially in the Near East."" At the same time, many royal persons were in England, including the Queen of Herzoslovakia, and Count Stylptitch; all the Balkan states were interested parties in discussions taking place. It is at this time that the Koh-i-Noor diamond disappeared in the plot. Later, in an unspecified year, the Herzoslovakians rose up against the king and his commoner wife. About that time, Mrs. Virginia Revel and her husband Tim were part of the diplomatic mission from the UK to Herzoslovakia, so that Mrs. Revel had met Prince Michael; she was the only such person at the house party, to know Prince Michael, but not the only person in the house. The time immediately after the war was when the theft, solved in this novel, happened.

On the wedding-day of his sickly son Conrad and princess Isabella, Conrad is crushed to death by a gigantic helmet that falls on him from above. This inexplicable event is particularly ominous in light of an ancient prophecy. Manfred, terrified that Conrad's death signals the beginning of the end for his line, resolves to avert destruction by marrying Isabella himself while divorcing his current wife Hippolita, whom he feels has failed to bear him a proper heir.

Niemand darf das ohne gräfliche Erlaubnis.“ ”Alles, was über dieses Buch gesagt werden kann, ist nur tastendes Nebenher.

Siddhartha,"THE CLASSIC NOVEL OF ONE MAN’S SEARCH FOR MEANING HAS DELIGHTED, INSPIRED, AND INFLUENCED GENERATIONS This classic allegorical novel of self-discovery by Hermann Hesse has touched the lives of millions since its original publication in 1922, after Hesse had spent time in India. Integrating Eastern and Western spiritual traditions with psychoanalysis and philosophy, this simple tale, written with a deep and moving empathy for humanity, provides the reader with insight into the philosophy and thoughts that shape Siddhartha’s path to enlightenment. The story revolves around Siddhartha, a wealthy young man who, during the time of the Buddha, casts off a life of privilege and comfort to take a spiritual journey on a quest for fulfillment and wisdom. His travels lead him through a range of human experiences from hunger and want, to passion, pleasure, pain, greed, yearning, boredom, love, despair and hope. The novel is infused with the sensibilities of Hesse’s time, synthesizing differing philosophies. On his journey, Siddhartha encounters Buddhist monks, successful merchants, as well as a courtesan named Kamala and a simple ferryman who has attained enlightenment. His quest takes him from the extremes of indulgence to the rigors of self-denial. With parallels to the enlightenment of the Buddha, Siddhartha learns that wisdom cannot be taught — it must come from one’s own experience and inner struggle as true knowledge is guided from within. Siddhartha presents an original view of man and culture, and the difficult process of self-discovery that leads to compatibility, harmony, and peace. A must read for anyone seeking self-knowledge in today’s materialistic world.",9781722524722,2023-11-14,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IJfeEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL872932W

War and Peace,"Widely regarded as the greatest novel in any language, War and Peace is primarily concerned with the histories of five aristocratic families--particularly the Bezukhovs, the Bolkonskys, and the Rostovs--the members of which are portrayed against a vivid background of Russian social life during the war against Napoleon (1805-14). The theme of war, however, is subordinate to the story of family existence, which involves Tolstoy's optimistic belief in the life-asserting pattern of human existence. The heroine, Natasha Rostova, for example, reaches her greatest fulfilment through her marriage to Pierre Bezukhov and her motherhood. The novel also sets forth a theory of history, concluding that there is a minimum of free choice; all is ruled by an inexorable historical determinism",9781904633853,2004,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-OQ2yHDIMQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL267171W

The Thirty-Nine Steps,"""I returned to the City about three o’clock on that Monday afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in the Old Country, and was fed up with it."" So opens John Buchan ́s The Thirty-Nine Steps and with it he creates a whole new genre: the adventure novel. Richard Hannay, the protagonist, finds himself reluctantly drawn into a chain of events that drags him away from the civilisation of London and into the Scottish wilderness, where he is chased both by villains and by policemen. This book has been adapted countless times, the most famous one certainly being Alfred Hitchcock’s 1935 version. Full of excitement and good humour, The Thirty-Nine Steps is a modern classic you’ll never want to put down. John Buchan (1875-1940) was a Scottish writer, historian and unionist. Born in Perth, he grew up in Fife where he developed the keen love for the Scottish nature that can be found in his work. After graduating from Oxford with a degree in Classics, he became the personal secretary of Alfred Milner, the Secretary of State of War and for the Colonies. Later he wrote for the British War Propaganda Bureau and was a correspondent in France for The Times. In 1935, he became viceregal representative in Canada, where he passed away five years later. He wrote throughout his life, leaving behind him hundreds of works, including novels, short shorties, and biographies of famous men such as Walter Scott and Oliver Cromwell, and he was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1928. Yet Buchan remains most famous for his spy thriller adventures, which have delighted readers for generations.",9789176393376,2017-01-04,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EiLZDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL76524W

When he protests, Rainsford the hunter becomes Rainsford the hunted. Sharing similarities with ""The Hunger Games"", starring Jennifer Lawrence, this is the story that created the template for pitting man against man.

Der Zauberberg,"‚Die Zergliederung der Welt‘: Wie der Untertitel dieses Buches anzeigt, steht in seinem Mittelpunkt die Rekonstruktion von Thomas Manns ‚analytischem Erzählen‘ im ‚Zauberberg‘. Verstanden ist darunter eine narrative Darstellung, die gleichbedeutend mit einer rationalen Analyse des Dargestellten ist. Dieses analytische Erzählen unterscheidet sich von den vertrauten Formen autoreflexiven Erzählens. Denn es bezieht sich nicht nur auf sich selbst, sondern nimmt ebenso die Gegenstände, von denen es handelt, ins Visier. Analytisches Erzählen betreibt im ‚Zauberberg‘ Analyse im etymologischen Sinn, d. h. Auflösung. Von hierher ergibt sich die Verbindung zur Geschichte, die der Roman erzählt, zur Welt des Sanatoriums, die im Zeichen von Tod und Krankheit steht. So bildet das Verhältnis von Rationalität zu Tod und Leben eines der großen Themen des ‚Zauberbergs‘. Literarhistorisch stellt er sich als ein post-realistischer Roman dar, der die Prinzipien realistischen Erzählens auf den Prüfstand stellt.",9783825347604,2020-10-22,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=smsKEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14866824W

Great Expectations,"Great Expectations is Charles Dickens's thirteenth novel. It is his second novel, after David Copperfield, to be fully narrated in the first person. Great Expectations is abildungsroman, or a coming-of-age novel, and it is a classic work of Victorian literature. It depicts the growth and personal development of an orphan named Pip. The novel was first published in serial form in Dickens' weekly periodical All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes.Great Expectations was to be twice as long, but constraints imposed by the management of All the Year Round limited the novel's length. Collected and dense, with a conciseness unusual for Dickens, the novel represents Dickens' peak and maturity as an author. According to G. K. Chesterton, Dickens penned Great Expectations in ""the afternoon of [his] life and fame."" It was the penultimate novel Dickens completed, preceding Our Mutual Friend.It is set among the marshes of Kent and in London in the early to mid-1800s. From the outset, the reader is ""treated"" by the terrifying encounter between Pip, the protagonist, and the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Great Expectations is a graphic book, full of extreme imagery, poverty, prison ships, ""the hulks,"" barriers and chains, and fights to the death. It therefore combines intrigue and unexpected twists of autobiographical detail in different tones. Regardless of its narrative technique, the novel reflects the events of the time, Dickens' concerns, and the relationship between society and man.The novel has received mixed reviews from critics: Thomas Carlyle speaks of ""All that Pip's nonsense,"" while George Bernard Shaw praised the novel as ""All of one piece and Consistently truthfull."" Dickens felt Great Expectations was his best work, calling it ""a very fine idea,"" and was very sensitive to compliments from his friends: ""Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken by the book.""",9786155529948,2024-01-19,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=49HsEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8721462W
